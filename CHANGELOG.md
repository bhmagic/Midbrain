# Changelog

### Revision 4 packaging corrections

- Applied the remaining Windows-gated `rustfmt` change in the Manager process launcher.
- Changed `scripts/validate.ps1` to run `cargo fmt --all` before the strict formatting check, preventing future platform-gated formatting drift.
- Added `scripts/update_manifests.ps1`; successful validation now refreshes component and repository SHA-256 manifests after formatting and builds.

## 0.3.10 — GitHub source cleanup (2026-07-20)

- Consolidated the Manager, Fabric, contracts, Orbbec Femto Bolt Provider, Local VIO Provider, and Test Agent into one source-only repository.
- Added a canonical documentation sequence and two functional tutorials.
- Added source validation, Python wheel build, GitHub publishing, and CI workflows.
- Corrected Windows PowerShell parsing in `scripts/validate.ps1` by delimiting `${LASTEXITCODE}` before a colon.
- Applied the complete Manager `rustfmt` layout reported by `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, including the process-ID expression missed in revision 2.
- Added the MIT License for original project code and a pending third-party audit notice.
- Declared MIT package metadata for the Rust crates and Python distributions, with the license text included in each Python wheel.
- Retained `Cargo.lock` for reproducible Rust application builds.
- Corrected stale component-version wording in package documentation.
- Excluded machine-local configuration, serial-bound calibration, API keys, proprietary SDK binaries, generated output, runtime state, and unrelated robot-arm Providers.
- Verified 37 Python regression tests and built all three Python wheels.
